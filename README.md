# cerebellum-atlas-analysis
Code and scripts used in analysis of snRNAseq mouse cerebellum atlas, as described in our recent
[preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.976407v1.abstract). 

Scripts used for clustering and cell type annotation are available in `annotation`. 
Scripts used to generate figures are available in `main_figures` and `extended_data_figures`. 

Some custom functions for Seurat/LIGER object manipulation and analysis (not yet available in LIGER) are included in `cb_custom_functions.R`.
